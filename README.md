# Android-Malware-Classification
Android, being the most widely used mobile operating system worldwide, is a major target for cyber threats, attracting 98\% of mobile banking attacks, according to Kaspersky. This underscores the urgent need for robust malware detection systems to protect users. As malware continually evolves, so must our defensive strategies. One innovative approach proposed here involves Machine Learning Analysis Tools. Although effective methods like DREBIN already exist, which employ a diverse range of application features such as strings, API calls, and app components, we decided to narrow the number of features used. This targeted approach aims to streamline the malware detection process.

In this project, we developed a machine learning-based detection method that exclusively relies on URL features, trained on the TESSERACT paper dataset. We then conducted an explainability analysis to understand the key characteristics of URLs commonly found in malicious applications. This in-depth examination also offered insights into our classifier's decision-making process and potential susceptibility to issues like "shortcut learning." Our model achieved an F1 score of 0.85 and identified the top 10 malware families in our dataset without any sample training with an average detection rate of 30%.
